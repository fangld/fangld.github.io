# Bio

Liangda Fang received his PhD from Sun Yat-sen University in 2015. After graduaction, he joined Jinan University as a lecturer, and was promoted to an associate professor in 2018. His reasearch is in the area of artificial intelligence including knowledge representation and reasoning, machine learning, planning and multi-agent systems. Liangda Fang has published 18 papers (including 12 CCF A class papers and 6 CCF B class papers). He served as local chair of the 14th International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS-2021), PC member of AAAI(2016, 2019, 2020), IJCAI(2018, 2020), ECAI-2020, and reviewer of journals: Artificial Intelligence, International Journal of Approximate Reasoning.
